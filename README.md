# polynomial-interpolationa-and-approximation
this code purposes for show graph in polynomial interpolation and polynomial approximation.
how actually lines will pass through the point with add some more degree with it.
and if we give some data, with many nodes, we can use approximation to show the line. 


for more data you can download it from : https://data.worldbank.org/
